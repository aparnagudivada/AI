# Generative AI

This repository focuses on advanced **Generative AI** techniques, including **Data Ingestion**, **FAISS** and **Chroma DB** for efficient data retrieval, **Data Transformers** for preprocessing, and **Embeddings** for semantic understanding. It also contains AI-driven projects including Text Summarization, Text to Math Problem Solver, and various Chatbots. The text summarization tool condenses large documents using LLMs. The math problem solver uses Googleâ€™s Gemma model to solve complex mathematical and logical questions.
